# Classifying-Clothes
This project is my attempt at image classification using the fashion MNIST data set (more information can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist). I tried using a CNN in PyTorch and the accuracy on the test-set ranged from 85-89%. Not really sure how to improve this/what next steps to take, so any tips/advice would be great!
